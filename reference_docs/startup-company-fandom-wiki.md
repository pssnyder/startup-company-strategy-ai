## Company Profile

[![Office Buildings](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/4/4f/Office_Buildings.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/272?cb=20170813170815)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/4/4f/Office_Buildings.png/revision/latest?cb=20170813170815)

[](/wiki/File:Office_Buildings.png)

A player's Company Profile is an important tool for measuring the performance and internal statistics related to the startup in question. Players can view their current tier progress, see recent unlocks, view specific company statistics, provide or remove benefits, and even upgrade their office building in this popover view.

## Statistics\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FCompany_Profile%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

An array of statistics are shown in the Company Profile popover view, including number of employees and workstations, number of contracts completed, and a summary of the workplace environment. Workplace environment is a cumulative addition of all furniture bonuses combined with bonuses for employee benefits that the company provides. Employees and contracts can be further viewed in detail in the Employees and Contracts popover menu items.

## Benefits\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FCompany_Profile%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Employee benefits make the company more attractive to potential employees. Beginner level employees only require a Work Environment Rating (WER) of 0 or 1, however, intermediate employees will require anywhere from 3-5 WER and expert employees will require even more. Benefits can be activated and deactivated at any time from their tab in the Company Profile popover window (under the Benefits tab). The cost per month to keep a benefit active is calculated based on the number of employees currently hired by the startup.

Currently, there are three office buildings in the game, a small, medium, and large variant. The player begins in the small building but can upgrade to the others at any point, provided he/she has the funds available. Once a player purchases a larger building size, they will not be able to downgrade to a smaller one in the future - only larger upgrades are allowed.

Startup Company progress is based on a 20-tier leveling system, with most employee types and items being unlocked within the first ten tiers. Each tier can be achieved by collecting XP from the game that is rewarded upon completion of contracts, assigning general work for employees, and many other in-game operations. For example: contracts typically reward the player with 6% of the total monetary value of the contract in the form of XP upon completion of said contract.

## Employees

Employees are the lifeblood of any company, and that is no different in Startup Company.

Employees can be hired via the Recruitment tab of the Employees popover view. The length of the recruitment posting can be increased on this screen as well as the desired employee level. After the posting has been made, players can choose the Candidates tab of the Employees popover view to see current applicants, their salary requirement, and WER (Workplace Environment Requirement). Applicants will continue to show up while the recruitment campaign is still live. Intermediate and expert employees are much more rare than beginner employees so it is recommended to allot more than a single day to recruiting them. Candidates will be available for hire for 24 hours after they submit their application, even after the player has hired another candidate. There is no maximum on the number of employees that can be hired from a single job listing.

On the Employees tab of that same popover view, a summary of currently employed individuals can be viewed along with their type, level (empty star for beginner, half-shaded for intermediate, and fully-shaded for expert), monthly salary, and current work status.

## Employee Types\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEmployees%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

## Productivity\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEmployees%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Total productivity of each employee directly correlates with how quickly they complete jobs that they are given. Productivity is calculated by four different factors:

1.  Base speed: this is the percentage that the employee had when hired. This number does not change after hiring an individual.
2.  Office bonus: furniture and objects placed into the office will often give an office bonus which is added up and will show in this part of the productivity calculation.
3.  Manager bonus: while under control of a manager, employees will get a bonus (as long as the manager is not on vacation).
4.  Mood penalty: mood falls over time depending on hours worked, employees being fired, and other things as well. This is the biggest hitter to productivity but will be reset to 0% after sending an employee on vacation.

## Vacations\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEmployees%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Employees can be sent on vacation individually through their popover view as well as on the HR Manager popover view. Employees will pause their current work and leave for vacation for a total of three days, returning on the hour they left on the third day. They will automatically begin working on the project that was paused when they left for vacation.

## Work Hours\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEmployees%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D6&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Upon hiring an HR Manager who is controlling current Managers in the company, a player may adjust each employees' hours individually. Working longer hours will bring their mood down at a faster rate each day, while working shorter hours will slow down the mood drop rate.

Employees may be fired from their popover view via a red X button in the top right corner of the window. Firing employees will result in the rest of the employees at the company taking a 5% reduction in productivity (based on a -5% mood penalty) for each employee fired.

At the beginning of the game, players are presented with a screen to take out a loan in order to kickstart the growth of their dream startup. The only loan available at this point in the game is the one offered by Eazy Money. Other loans are unlocked later in the game. Loans can be paid back at any time during the game.

[![Game Over Credit](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/8/86/Game_Over_Credit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20170813135520)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/8/86/Game_Over_Credit.png/revision/latest?cb=20170813135520)

If a player falls below a balance of $0.00 in their bank account, they will get a warning message stating that the bank has allotted them $10,000 of credit (negative balance) to work with. However, if the player falls below -$10,000 in-game, they will not be able to continue.

## Budget\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FFinances%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

[](/wiki/File:Budget.png)

Keeping an eye on the flow of money in and out of a startup company is crucial to its success. Fortunately, the Budget tab in the Finance popover view has everything a player would want to know about expenses and profits. On the left side of the screen, a list of expenses expected over the next 30 days is displayed. This includes salaries, rent, benefits, and more. On the right side of the screen, a list of income accumulated over the previous 30 days is displayed. This includes money made from investments, contract completions, and product income. At the bottom of both lists, players can find a comprehensive total (a negative value for the expenses and positive value for the income). Below these columns, a breakdown of current bank balance, monthly profits, and daily profits based on the numbers above can be found.

## Getting Started

Congrats! You have just bought, downloaded, and started up the latest and greatest company management game, and need help getting started. Well, you've come to the right place! As of version 1.4, there is an in-game tutorial in the form of milestones. However, this tutorial leaves the finer aspects of gameplay up to the player to figure out.

## Contents

*   [1 Starting a New Game](#Starting_a_New_Game)
*   [2 Interface](#Interface)
*   [3 Recruiting your First Employee](#Recruiting_your_First_Employee)
*   [4 Research](#Research)

## Starting a New Game\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Started%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

When you first start up the game, you will be prompted to create a new game. By clicking the '+ New Game' button, you can also start a new game any time you like.

A short pop-up menu will prompt you to customize your game, with three (or four) tabs:

*   Game Mode & Company Name
    *   You can choose between Career Mode and Custom Game for your game mode. For beginners, Career Mode is recommended.
    *   You will be prompted to choose a company name. Alternately, you can use the blue icon with two arrows on the right to randomly pick one.
    *   You also can choose an icon for your website.
*   Setup CEO
    *   On this screen, you may name your CEO and choose an avatar for them. This has no functional effect.
    *   Additionally, you may also pick a background for your CEO of either Ex-Designer, Ex-Developer, or Ex-Manager. Depending on the background you may change your CEO's role to act as a [Designer](https://startupcompany.fandom.com/wiki/Designer), [Developer](https://startupcompany.fandom.com/wiki/Developer) or [Manager](https://startupcompany.fandom.com/wiki/Manager) rather than a recruiter. This is done by selecting them and clicking on the blue button to the left of the 'Training' tab and can be done anytime in the game.

*   Configure Website
    *   After naming your website, choose which variety of website you want to develop. This will determine your competitors, as well as what sorts of work your employees will have to do later in the game. Social Media is the most straightforward route, so it is recommended for beginners.

After you have adjusted these settings to your satisfaction, click Start Game.

## Interface\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Started%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

The game itself presents all of the information in a structured and straight-forward method. There are two main areas of interest: an information bar at the top of the screen displaying basic gameplay information, and a menu at the bottom of the screen containing a series of buttons. There are a lot of pieces of information to take in at first glance. The most important ones at the moment are your time controls, the current time, and your current money (found in the upper bar), and the Shop and Research buttons (the first two on the lower bar). However, it is good to learn what everything does at some point.

[![InfoBarMk2](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/2/2b/InfoBarMk2.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/196?cb=20200414154932)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/2/2b/InfoBarMk2.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20200414154932)

[](/wiki/File:InfoBarMk2.PNG)

The information menu as of 1.4

The information bar at the top contains, from left to right and top to bottom:

*   The current date
*   Any new "jeets". Clicking on this area brings up the Jitter website, which allows you to gauge public reaction to new features and keep track of stocks.
*   A countdown until the CEO's retirement. Clicking on this area brings up a summary of your CEO's retirement plans -- don't worry about this for now.
*   A series of time controls -- use the pause button to stop time, the single playback button to play at normal speed, the 2x button to play at 5x speed, and the 3x button to play at 10x speed.
*   The current time, given by default in the 24 hour format
*   Current research points. Clicking on this area brings up the Research menu.
*   Current finances. Clicking on this area brings up the Finance menu.

Additionally, horizontally through this menu, the progression of time throughout the day is visually indicated by a thin blue line that progresses from left to right.

To the left of this menu is a '?' Help button, which will remind players of concepts that the in-game tutorial has previously touched upon.

At the bottom of the screen, a menu bar is shown with icons representing different pop-up menus within the game that the player can select. Throughout development this menu has changed, but currently it consists of eight buttons. To the left of this bar is a Map icon, which will return you to the initial map screen.

[![BottomMenu](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/3/3a/BottomMenu.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20200414160235)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/3/3a/BottomMenu.png/revision/latest?cb=20200414160235)

[](/wiki/File:BottomMenu.png)

The menu across the bottom.

From left to right, these buttons lead to; the Purchase Item menu, the Research menu, the Finance menu, your Inventory, the Employees menu, the Company and Competitors menu, and the Outsourcing menu. The last two will be almost completely useless to you for much of the early to mid-game.

## Recruiting your First Employee\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Started%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

[![Employee Recruitment](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/d/d6/Employee_Recruitment.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/248?cb=20170814015356)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/d/d6/Employee_Recruitment.png/revision/latest?cb=20170814015356)

[](/wiki/File:Employee_Recruitment.png)

Once you have started the game, you will meet Pam from Johnson Invest. She is your adviser, and will guide you throughout the game, giving you new milestones to work towards as you complete prior ones.

You are first prompted to choose an office to rent, specifically 4 West Bridge Street. If you are having difficulty locating it, it is along the lower left edge of the map. Click the building, then click Rent. You will be upgrading later, but for the moment this is the most economical choice.

Next, Pam will require you to build a desk and seat yourself. Desks can be purchased via the Shop menu. Place it down anywhere. You can rearrange it at any time by right-clicking it, and from there rotate it via right-click or the R key.

Once placed, left-click the desk and select your CEO. This will automatically open up your CEO's popup menu, which has four tabs along the top: Recruitment, Training, Stats, and Retirement. For now, you should be on the Recruitment tab.

Pam will inform you how to begin headhunting: click the large green START HEADHUNTING button, which will bring you to the Headhunting screen. You will be headhunting for a Beginner (the only type you currently have unlocked) Designer and a Beginner Developer. Pick one of those varieties and Start Headhunting. Ensure that your game is not still paused with the time controls at the top of the screen. Headhunting will take some time. Whilst your CEO is Headhunting, explore the other screens.

Training allows your employees to work faster without paying any extra salary: however, training employees are unable to perform their normal tasks, so think strategically when deciding when to train employees. Once an employee has been trained up to their maximum, you have the opportunity to promote them to a higher level. Promote only when necessary: promoted employees are required for more advanced items and can work faster, but they have more demands (making them more difficult to keep happy) and are more expensive to keep.

The Stats page shows you a number of important statistics. In addition to displaying salary, hours, and level, it shows speed and desires. Faster employees are more desirable: a happy employee works faster, as does a well-trained one. Happiness is influenced by a variety of factors, but generally every employee likes to have their desires met, to receive bonuses, and to have time off.

Disregard the Retirement tab for now. Head back to the Recruitment tab. After a day or so of recruiting, you should have 3-5 potential candidates. When recruiting Beginner candidates, your sole consideration is speed. The black number indicates their current speed, while the second, gray number indicates the maximum speed they can reach with training. The first number generally ranges between 80-140%, while the second generally is between 160-200%. For your first few hires, you won't have much time to train up your employees, so pick your employee with the best current speed and click on their name.

Next, you will enter the Negotiation screen. Here, you can change Monthly Salary and Signing Bonus to create an enticing offer. Generally, Beginner employees will sign for $4,500-5,500, but going lower is possible. Tips:

*   Start on the low end of salary and work your way up, meeting the employee about halfway per offer. If you offered $4,000 and they counteroffered $6,000, meet them in the middle with a $5,000 offer.
*   Signing bonuses can be used to sweeten a deal. They are a larger upfront investment, but if you plan to keep an employee for a long time, you will save. If you manage to save $500 in salary with a $2,000 bonus, you'll break even in four months.
*   Keep an eye on satisfaction. Satisfaction can be seen by hovering your mouse over the smiley face next to the counteroffer from the candidate. Prolonged negotiation will lower happiness, as will an offensively low offer.
*   Most employees will sign for whatever the approximate halfway point is on the bar, or close to it.
*   Each employee has a hidden salary expectation. This is generally linked to their current speed: faster employees will demand more money. The key to getting a good deal then is to hire an employee with a low current speed but a high maximum speed, such as 80/200: these employees will generally be cheap to hire and highly profitable.

Using this process, hire a Designer and a Developer. Seat them both when hired, by purchasing more desks and clicking them to place them. To speed up time, whenever the workday completes. After you seat your second employee, Pam will reappear, and ask you to research a Landing Page. To do so, open up the Research menu from the bottom menu (alternately, by clicking the Research Points counter on the top men) and open the Features tab along the left. You will be using all of these tabs at some point, as guided by Pam or by your own intuition, but for the moment unlock the Landing Page. You will receive more you can run the Time Machine to quickly skip the nighttime.

Congratulations! You have a workforce!

## Research\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Started%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

The research screen, opened to the Features tab.

After you seat your second employee, Pam will reappear, and ask you to research a Landing Page. To do so, open up the Research menu from the bottom menu (alternately, by clicking the Research Points counter on the top men) and open the Features tab along the left. You will be using all of these tabs at some point, as guided by Pam or by your own intuition, but for the moment unlock the Landing Page and hit Confirm. You can acquire more Research Points later by hiring a [Researcher](/wiki/Researcher "Researcher"), but for the moment you have a finite supply.

## Adding Features\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Started%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

[![WebsiteInterface](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/f/f9/WebsiteInterface.png/revision/latest?cb=20200414180207)

[![WebsiteInterface](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/f/f9/WebsiteInterface.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/124?cb=20200414180207)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/f/f9/WebsiteInterface.png/revision/latest?cb=20200414180207)

[](/wiki/File:WebsiteInterface.png)

Your main project is your Website. You have just one for now, but all of your websites are displayed along the right edge of the screen. The name, current ranking, hosting usage, potential users, and user change are all shown at a glance. To manage it, click it. You will be set onto the Stats page. This is a useful location to see all of your website's statistics, particularly growth, income, and server usage. But at the moment we want to look at the Features tab, so navigate to the tab with a small megaphone next to it. You have a limited number of slots for features: three at the moment, and it will take a good amount of time until you can unlock more than that, so customization at this early stage is slim. Again, there's a fair bit of data here, but it's either self-explanatory or not relevant for the moment, so go ahead and click Add Feature.

Features are categorized as Base Features, Revenue Features, or Enhancement Features. The Landing Page is a base feature, so ensure that you're on that sub-tab and Add Feature. The four icons beneath the description describe what you'll need to produce in order to level up.

## Upgrading Features\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Started%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D6&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

In order to get people using your website, thus getting views you can monetize via ad revenue, you have to upgrade your features. Upgrading a feature increases the maximum potential users. When developing your website, ideally you want to make sure you always have room to grow your following, so a slow and steady climb is ideal.

To upgrade a feature, you will first need to produce the prerequisite components. A Landing Page requires 1 UI Component, 1 Backend Component, 1 Blueprint Component, and 1 Graphics Component. The first two are made by developers, and the latter two are made by designers.

[![Developmentscreen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/8/89/Developmentscreen.png/revision/latest?cb=20200414181644)

[![Developmentscreen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/8/89/Developmentscreen.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20200414181644)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/8/89/Developmentscreen.png/revision/latest?cb=20200414181644)

[](/wiki/File:Developmentscreen.png)

To produce components, click on your employees, navigate to the Development tab (which they should be on by default), and click the components. Your employees will cycle through whatever you assign them, so you merely need to assign one of each per employee. Remember that only developers can create UI Components and Backend Components, and only Designers can make Blueprint Components and Graphics Components. Each component additionally has a time requirement: this is divided by the individual employee's speed to produce an actual time.

Once you have one of each component (you can check this either in the employees' popup menus, the Inventory screen, or from the Landing Page feature's screen) navigate your way back to the Feature screen and click Upgrade under the feature. On this screen, click Upgrade to Level 1. This will consume the required components and level up your feature.

## What Next\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Started%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D7&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Make sure to save often, by hitting Esc to return to the save menu/pause menu. Pam will guide you through the next steps of marketing, advertising, hosting, and expansion. If you ever get stuck, the in-game help guide is a valuable resource.

## Investing

Investors are people that will give you a chunk of money in return for more ownership of your company, and if you succeed, they make a profit out of it. They are a good way to get money to develop your startup faster, however, this will require you to sacrifice some control over your website if you get below majority shareholder (51%), unless you buy back the shares, at a usually higher cost that what they paid for them.

Investors Screen

You start with investors known as Johnson Invest, they help fund your company through its beginning stages, by giving money when you reach certain milestones This often helps you early on when you're not making a profit. However, you can also choose to just start without investors, Although it will make the game much harder, as you need to become profitable quickly, or you'll run out of money. 

  
You can also buy back the shares from Johnson Invest, (and other companies) in which the milestones will dissapear, including the lady who gives you tasks. However, as you become more sucessful, their share of the company gets more valuable (as with other investors too), so it's best to create a separate website instead, that way, when it becomes profitable, you can buy out the investors without their shares increasing in value.

  
Investing in other companies (competitors) is much different, as they don't buy back shares, and they can't choose to deny the buying of shares. However, if you own a competitor completely (100% of all shares) you can merge it's users with one of your competing companies in the same category, provided that you have enough potential users to do so. This only works if the competitor you bought is in the same category as your website, e.x. you cannot merge users from a video sharing service to a dating app, however, you can merge users from a video streaming service to your own video streaming service. This is an efficient way of getting users without marketing.

Assigning production employees to a manager's roster make the employee follow the manager's assigned [production plan.](/wiki/Production_plan "Production plan") If no production plan is set then the employees will idle. Non-production employees, such as sales executives and researchers do not need a production plan.

Managers provide a productivity bonus to all of the employees on their roster. This bonus is evenly split between the number of employees that the manager is actively in charge of at that time. The bonus does not apply if the manager is at home.

The bonus is directly tied to the productivity level of the manager. For example if a manager is has a productivity of 500% and is managing one employee, the manager will give a 500% bonus to the employees output, 2 employees 250% each etc.

## Negotiation

[![Negotiation Screen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/7/78/Negotiation_Screen.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20200414165052)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/startupcompany/images/7/78/Negotiation_Screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20200414165052)

[](/wiki/File:Negotiation_Screen.png)

An example negotiation.

Negotiation is an important gameplay mechanic. A CEO who is good at it can make a lot of money: one who's not may find their workforce saturated with high-cost, low-skill workers. Fortunately, every player can learn how to make good hiring choices

## Contents

*   [1 Interface](#Interface)
*   [2 Hiring Beginner Employees](#Hiring_Beginner_Employees)
*   [3 Strategy](#Strategy)
    *   [3.1 Signing Bonuses](#Signing_Bonuses)
*   [4 Hiring Intermediate and Expert Employees](#Hiring_Intermediate_and_Expert_Employees)

## Interface\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNegotiation%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

After headhunting, a list of prospective employees is produced. Clicking on any one of them will open up the Negotiation screen.

This screen is divided into three windows. The upper-left window bears the potential hire's name, as well as their current place of employment, age, speed, salary expectation, and demands. 

Below that window is the Send Offer screen. Here, you can customize what offer you would like to send, formed of components Monthly Salary and Signing Bonus. Clicking the Send Offer button will send a new offer to the potential hire, which they will either counteroffer or accept. 

## Hiring Beginner Employees\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNegotiation%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Unlike with Intermediate or Expert employees, you can't research Beginner employees' salary expectations or demands. On the flipside, you have a lot of potential employees in case negotiations with one go awry. This ultimately simplifies the strategy for eliciting a good deal from potential hires.

The primary consideration for Beginner employees is speed. A faster employee produces more products. However, fast employees are also usually significantly more expensive than slow ones. Nonetheless, when factors like seating constraints and production chains are considered, a small workforce of efficient employees is usually preferable to a large workforce of slow employees. 

However, there's a catch. Employees typically price themselves based off of their current speed, the percentage given in black. However, their maximum speed (given in gray) can very often be significantly higher. If an employer has the means to hire such an employee then train them for an extended period, they can very often turn out to be a cost-effective investment. 

## Strategy\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNegotiation%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

When producing a starting offer, a range of $4,000-5,000 is a good starting point. Beginning too low risks offending the potential hire and lowering the chance of a good deal, while beginning too high risks overpaying an employee when you could have acquired a much better deal. Where you begin on this range generally should depend on how fast the employee's current speed is: a lower current speed usually means that they will accept a lower price.

A typical negotiation will consist of several offers and counteroffers. When the potential hire counteroffers, consider their counteroffer -- is it wildly out of your price range, or just a touch too high? Keep in mind that your final offer will probably end up being somewhere between the two. If you are still willing to continue negotiating, send an increased offer: decreasing your offer will only offend the potential hire. They will hopefully lower their counteroffer in response. Keep an eye on the face next to their offer -- the lower it gets, the less willing they are to negotiate, and they will walk away if it gets too low. 

A safe counteroffer is one about halfway between your offer and their counteroffer. If you continually offer in this manner, expect to wind up about halfway between the two. 

### Signing Bonuses\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNegotiation%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Signing Bonuses can be used to entice a potential hire to take a salary below what they would normally accept. These are an excellent strategy for hiring long-term hires, such as developers, as they tend to pay for themselves if the employee stays on for long enough. They are also a good choice for using investments. 

## Hiring Intermediate and Expert Employees\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FNegotiation%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Higher-level employees are similar to Beginners when hiring, with a few differences. They will request more money, and a Beginner-level offer will likely offend them. If you are unsure, the amount which is about halfway through the slider is a good bet.

Additionally, you can research their salary expectations and demands. Salary expectations are even better for gauging an initial offer: as always, start a couple hundred to a thousand below what they request, and you will likely end up paying less. Demands are useful if you have only partially researched the luxuries for that tier. 

Despite their initial higher costs, hiring at a higher level is often a good idea, for example when a higher-level employee is required for a certain project and there is not enough time to train up a lower-level employee. Since employees get automatic salary hikes when they get promoted anyway, and you'll likely have to entice them away from a rival offer, any financial differences usually even out.

Production plans allow you to assign minimum and relative levels for components. These plans are then assigned to one or more managers. All managers using the same production plan work to the same combined goal level. Plans can be done based on employee type: example developers, or could be based on a more agile approach of creating multi disciplinary teams that build components needed for specific features.

### Options\[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fstartupcompany.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FProduction_plan%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

*   A plan can be set to continue producing at the same relative levels once the goal has been reached.
*   Skip production of the module if any prerequisite ingredients are missing: otherwise the staff member will idle awaiting the required ingredients.

Features are the bread and butter of projects that are created. Each feature can be added and upgraded in a product, which will in turn boost the hype of that product, which increases the user base. Components are required for each feature to be researched. Each feature will have a certain number of cycles it must be researched before it is available - it is not a one time job like components.

Sales Executive working at a Beginner Workstation.

### Function

Increases number of new contracts acquired.

### Unlock Level

Game start

Sales Executives are a type of employee in Startup Company that manage advertising contracts for your company. Each Sales Executive can manage only one contract at a time.

When placed at a desk, the Sales Executive will automatically start searching for new leads, which will appear in their GUI. By pressing the "FILTER" button, the player can give a specific range for the number of Impressions desired, and the Sales Executive will only find contracts within that range.

Once the player has found an offer they like, they can click the "Negotiate" button. The screen that appears allows the player to choose the website, the type of ads, and the timeslot to use for this contract.

Below the timeslot selection, the player can see the number of impressions the selected timeslot generated in the previous day, along with a slider to adjust the amount of impressions to guarantee. It is generally best to guarantee the maximum amount of impressions the contract allows, and search for contracts close to the number of impressions your website is generating, as lowering this slider will decrease the initial offer.

Below the impressions section, the player can select the length of time the contract should last. Raising this slider will increase the client's initial offer, but you will have to wait longer to take a new contract.

The player can choose to either accept the initial offer given, or negotiate with the client to raise the price. Negotiating contracts is an easy way to raise your company's income, and you can often get an extra $4/CPM or more if done right.

The amount the client will raise or lower their offer by seems to be affected by how much you raise or lower yours. So if you drop your offer from $14.00/CPM to $13.00/CPM, the client will likely raise their offer by $0.80/CPM-$1.00/CPM in response. But if you only drop it from $14.00/CPM to $13.80/CPM, the client will probably only raise their offer $0.20/CPM or less.

The player can reliably get contracts with a rate of $12.50/CPM or more by starting with a contract that shows $8.40/CPM or more on the main screen, raising the contract length to 10 days, and starting with an initial counteroffer of $15.00/CPM.

Note: The Sales Executive used to manage outsourcing contracts, but they were repurposed to manage advertising contracts when the Outsourcing Executive was added.

This page is unfinished, it needs the following:

*   More images (and updated ones)
*   Specific numbers and equations for how negotiation and generating contracts works

Servers are an important part of any Company.

They allow you to produce your own CU for a lower day to day cost.

Servers are Costly to set up (Like in real life) but have big pay off's if done right

There are 3 different types of server and all 3 are needed in any setup.

*   Web servers (Pink)
*   Database Servers (Blue)
*   Cache Servers (Green)

There are also 3 different sizes for each type.

CU is only produced when all 3 servers are used together. However, they must also be balanced to that they produce near the same amount space or you will be wasting some.

An efficient starting setup is to use 3 Small Web Servers with 2 Database Servers and 1 Cache Server. This will result in 100 being wasted on both the web and database servers (but this can be compensated for with Overclocking). This will cost a Total of 61,600 (with the Small Rack bought as well) and will need 12 Firewall, 12 Virtual Hardware and 12 Operating System (All produced by the SysAdmin). This set up will result in 7000 CU (or 8400 CU if you overclock the Cache Server)

Overclocked Cache

7000

Yes by 20% (to 120%)

61600

8400

With 2 of these Racks, you will be creating 16800 CU (overclocked Cache) for a cost of $175 a Day. Which is a lot better than the Hosted option of 15000 CU for $900 a Day.

## Supporter

A supporter will resolve support tickets from their specified support ticket queue.  A supporter is required to complete milestone 20 'Resolve 2 support tickets'.  Games hints suggest the need have supporters at different experience levels to handle different complexity levels, but in early game, one supporter is sufficient.

### Function

Create virtual servers to support applications.

### Unlock Level

Tier 6

SysAdmins are in charge of creating virtual servers to allow for expansion of applications. The ability to hire SysAdmins is unlocked at tier 6.

As products grow in user base, they will require more virtual servers to support the increased amount of traffic generated. SysAdmin will create components to fulfill this increased traffic, which can be monitored under the Hosting tab of the popover view for each application that a player has created.
