## **üéØ Strategic Overview: The Pivot to Quality**

We have successfully bootstrapped, scaled rapidly, and launched our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (Landing Page \+ Video Functionality). Our current strategy must pivot from **"rapid growth"** to **"operational efficiency"** to stop the financial burn.

| Status | Metric | Value | Problem & Solution |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **CRITICAL** | User Satisfaction | **50%** | **Problem:** Low satisfaction drives users away and wastes marketing/dev efforts. **Solution:** Immediate Quality & Efficiency (Q/E) Improvement Sprint. |
| **High Risk** | Monthly Burn Rate | **\~$74,300** | **Problem:** We are currently unprofitable. **Solution:** Boost Q/E, start a revenue feature (Ads), and fully utilize our highly-paid team. |
| **Liquid** | Cash-on-Hand | $162,892 | **Runway:** 2.19 Months. We have enough cash for a focused "fix-it" sprint. |
| **Team Size** | Employees | 9 | **Action:** Need to maximize the output of our new Intermediate-level employees (Adam, Mario, Clifford, etc.) via Production Plans. |

## **üõ†Ô∏è Current Development Focus: Fix the Foundation**

Our immediate goal is to fix our existing features, which have very low Quality (Q=3) and Efficiency (E=5 or E=1).

### **Current Goal: Quality & Efficiency Sprint**

| Feature | Current Q / Max | Current E / Max | Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Landing Page** | Q: 3 / 9000 | E: 5 / 140 | **UPGRADE PRIORITY 1** |
| **Video Functionality** | Q: 0 / 9000 | E: 1 / 140 | **UPGRADE PRIORITY 2** |

### **Next Strategic Decision: Q/E Target**

Before setting up the Production Plan, we need an agreed-upon goal. Over-optimizing now is slow and expensive.

**Recommendation:** Set an immediate Q/E target of **Level 50** for both the Landing Page and Video Functionality features. This is a low-risk, fast win that should push user satisfaction back into the green (above 75%) and stabilize our growth.

## **üí° Production Plan Workflow & Component Needs**

Your request for clarity on the Production Plan is an excellent example of **high cohesion**‚Äîwe need a document that tightly focuses on that single task.

When you go to the game's feature upgrade menu, please tell me:

1. **Is a specific module (like InterfaceModule or FrontendModule) required to raise Quality/Efficiency on the Landing Page?**  
   Landing page current upgrade reqs: level 4, 1 ui component,  
2. **How many of the required components are currently in the inventory?** (We have many low-level components like Blueprint, UI, etc., saved in the game\_transactions.md file now.)

### **Setting up the Plan (Answer to your query)**

* **Production Plan vs. Employee Queue:** When you create a **Production Plan** and assign it to an employee, **it typically overrides their current individual queue tasks.** To be safe and maximize cohesion, **always clear the employee's individual component queue** before assigning them to a detailed Production Plan.  
* **Component Requirements:** This template will help us track the components:
