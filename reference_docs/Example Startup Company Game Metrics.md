* **Available CU:** 500 (Provided by 1 Small Virtual Server)  
* **Server Usage:** 5% (Stable \- plenty of capacity right now.)

## **Development & Efficiency Metrics**

* **Research Points (RP):** 102  
* **Current Features:** 2 (Landing Page, Video Functionality)  
* **Feature Quality/Efficiency:** Landing Page (Quality: 3, Efficiency: 5), Video Functionality (Quality: 0, Efficiency: 1). **NOTE: Quality is extremely low.**  
* **Team Utilization:** Teams are currently idling or assigned to general component production, leading to low efficiency (violating the WIP Limits policy).

## **Critical Issue: Low Satisfaction (50%)**

The primary source of waste and inefficiency is likely the **50% User Satisfaction**. Low satisfaction means:

1. Users leave faster, reducing overall growth.  
2. Marketing campaigns are less effective.  
3. Any development time spent improving *low-quality* features is wasted effort.

## **ðŸ’¡ Strategic Next Step: Solve the Satisfaction Problem**

The immediate problem is not building a new feature but fixing the *quality* and *efficiency* of our existing features to boost satisfaction above the 50% mark. **Low satisfaction (50%) is currently bottlenecking all user growth.**

We must pivot from blindly producing components to an **Improvement Sprint** focused on **Quality and Efficiency**.

**Our new priority is to use our highly-paid team to increase the Quality and Efficiency (Q/E) of our active features (Landing Page and Video Functionality).**

What Q/E value should we aim for first? For a beginner feature, targeting **Quality (Q) and Efficiency (E) up to level 50** is usually achievable quickly.

What do you think? Should we re-task Mario (Dev) and Adam (Designer) immediately to upgrade the Q/E of the Landing Page, or focus on research first?
